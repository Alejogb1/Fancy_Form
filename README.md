# Fancy_Form

Pure and exclusively created to reinforce learning about Vanilla JS and Scss. Within its functionalities, such as saving every input entered by the user so as to display its name at the end of the forming process. Also, some animations and a progress bar at the bottom of the input field were created. Used Npm and Version Control for committing and working with tree branches.
